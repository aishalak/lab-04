## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# Packages for Lab 4
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
```

#Exploratory Data Analysis
Exercise 1
```{r}
diamonds <- diamonds %>% filter(carat == 0.5, !is.na(carat))
```
The new dataset now has 1258 observations. 

Exercise 2 
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = fct_infreq(cut))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs (x = "Cut", y = "Observations", title = "Cut Vs Observations") +
  coord_flip()
```
The Cut vs Observations plot indicates that cut levels "fair" and "good" have the least amount of observations. 
Exercise 3
```{r}
diamonds <- diamonds %>% mutate(cut = fct_lump_n(cut, n = 3))
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = fct_infreq(cut))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(x = "Cut", y = "Observations", title = "Cut Vs Observations") +
  coord_flip()
```
Exercise 4
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_point(aplha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Cut", y = "Price (US Dollars)", title = "Cut vs. Price")
```
```{r}
plot <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) + 
  %>%
      mutate(obs_num = row_number()) #add observation number for plots
```
